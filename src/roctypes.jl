## TNT: a target-nontarget tuple
"""
`TNT(tar, non`) is a type that holds target and non-target scores in a test for a two-class
classifier.
"""
struct TNT{T<:Real}
    """target scores (scofres for which, actually, the one hypothesis is true)"""
    tar::Vector{T}              # target scores
    """non-target scores (score for which, actually, the oter hypothesis is true)"""
    non::Vector{T}              # non-target scores
end

## Roc: essential data to store Receiver Operating Characteristics
"""
`Roc` is a type that stores the essential performance information that can be extracted from a
set of supervised trials, i.e., target and non-target scores from a two-class classifier.  Apart from
the (minimalized) arrays for probabilities of false-alarm and miss---the coordinates of the ROC
curve---, they are the threshold for these, a boolean whether-or-not this point lies on the
convex hull, and the associated optimal log-likelihood-ratio associated to the line segment.
"""
mutable struct Roc{T<:Real}
    pfa::Vector{Float64}        # probability of false alarm
    pmiss::Vector{Float64}      # probability of miss
    ch::BitArray                # point lies on convex hull
    Î¸::Vector{T}                # threshold
    llr::Vector{Float64}        # optimal log likelihood ratio
end

## A traditional decision cost function
"""
`DCF` is a type that holds one or more cost functions with which the performance of a two-class
classifier can be assessed.  Any of the fields can be either a scalar or an array.
